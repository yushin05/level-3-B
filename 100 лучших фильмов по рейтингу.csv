She starts a grassroots movement that is fueled by passion, but appears to be losing the battle. Then, unexpectedly, she realizes that the corporations accidentally left her a giant loophole. In a scramble to take advantage of this unforeseen gift, she leads the crusade passing legislation protecting animals from de-clawing in seven cities in just six weeks.","0.047234","/2APDMz9l55lYjTjEIlbunhX1Gba.jpg","[]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]","2013-09-27","0","58","[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]","Released","A story about the fight for those who have no voice.","The Paw Project","False","10","1"

In one of them they grow up as siblings who desire each other and try to give shape to their love without sexual fulfilment; in the other they are a young man and woman who form an awkward friendship instead of succumbing to their feelings for each other. GermÃ¡n finds himself in a discordant relationship with Mariela. Marielaâ€™s brother is interested in Bruno. Bruno is with Romina, but wants to be with GermÃ¡n. Playfully alternating between these two realities, the lovers find themselves drawn into ever new couplings in order to explore their intuitive feelings â€“ cautiously, but at the same time prepared to lose everything.","0.35236","/bX6HbAYnblsfsnFsMzdLO3yDHZo.jpg","[{'name': 'INCAA', 'id': 8205}, {'name': 'Universidad del Cine', 'id': 11999}, {'name': 'Oh My Gomez!
